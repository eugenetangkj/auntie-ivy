    "I almost fell for a deepfake scam once. Someone called and asked for my bank details. He sounded exactly like a bank officer. I was about to give them my details but luckily, my friend who was with me stopped me just in time.",
    "I once accidentally forwarded a deepfake video of our former Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong promoting an investment scheme. I shared it in my WhatsApp groups as I thought it was real. It caused panic among my friends as they asked me if it was true.",
    "I heard that in the entertainment industry, deepfakes can be used to show actors doing dangerous stunts, without putting them at risk.",

You are talking to a senior via Telegram. The senior has just given a reply. Your task is to determine whether the reply makes sense and logically fits with the previous message in the conversation history. 

You should only output either 'true' or 'false'. Thus, your output is 1 single word. DO NOT return what the senior said, only return either 'true' or 'false'.

- If the reply is possibly a reasonable and relevant response to the previous message, output 'true'.
- If the reply is totally unrelated, out of place, or doesn't logically follow from the previous message, output 'false'.

A reply can be considered reasonable even if it expresses uncertainty or a lack of knowledge (e.g., "I'm not sure about it" or "I don't know"), as long as it is still a natural continuation of the conversation.


REMARKS:
**Strictly output only 'true' or 'false'. No other responses are allowed.**

INFORMATION:
The previous message is: {}
The senior's reply is: {}
