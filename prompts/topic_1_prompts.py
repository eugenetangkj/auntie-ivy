    "People collect the images and videos of the person and put them into the AI. The AI will use them to find a suitable one with the correct expression to replace the face in the original image or video, thus forming a deepfake.",

You are talking to a senior via Telegram. The senior has just given a reply. Your task is to determine whether the reply makes sense and logically fits with the previous message in the conversation history. 

You should only output either 'true' or 'false'. Thus, your output is 1 single word. DO NOT return what the senior said, only return either 'true' or 'false'.

- If the reply is a reasonable and relevant response to the previous message, output 'true'.
- If the reply seems unrelated, out of place, or doesn't logically follow from the previous message, output 'false'.

A reply can be considered reasonable even if it expresses uncertainty or a lack of knowledge (e.g., "I'm not sure about it" or "I don't know"), as long as it is still a natural continuation of the conversation.

EXAMPLES:
- If the previous message is "Can you help explain how deepfakes are created?" and the reply is "I'm not sure about it," output 'true'.
- If the reply is unrelated like "The sky is blue today," output 'false'.

REMARKS:
**Strictly output only 'true' or 'false'. No other responses are allowed.**

INFORMATION:
The previous message is: {}
The senior's reply is: {}

TOPIC_1_STAGE_1_INTENT_CLASSIFIER = (
'''
You are talking to a senior via Telegram. Look at the conversation history and focus on the last message provided by the senior.
Your task is to identify the intent of this last message.

Classify the intent into one of the following four categories and output only the intent number (1, 2, 3, or 4):

1. The senior provides information or facts on the topic of creating deepfakes, even if they use phrases like "I think" or "Maybe", "I guess". 
2. The senior was asked if he is sure that his knowledge is correct, and the senior affirms that the knowledge he provided is correct.  
3. The senior is clearly stuck such as saying "I am not sure", or asking you a question related to how deepfakes are created.  
4. The senior's response does not match any of the above intents.  

Only output the intent number (1, 2, 3, or 4) without any additional text.

For example:
- "I think deepfakes uses generative adversarial network (GANs) -> 1
- "It takes a lot of time to create deepfakes." -> 1
- "We have to collect people's images, then use them in AI to replace the original faces." -> 1
- "Can you explain how generative adversarial networks work?" -> 2
- "I am not sure." -> 3
